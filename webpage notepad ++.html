<p>Welcome to my website! I was born right here in Maine, a small town called Bucksport. I've lived there all of my life. My hobbies and passions consist of sports such as: Basketball and baseball. I also enjoy gaming. When I'm not in class, playing sports, or doing homework. I'm at home playing games. I have an older brother that I'm pretty close to. </p>
